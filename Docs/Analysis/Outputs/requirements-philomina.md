# Project Requirements
Our FreeNove Smart Car Project includes four projects, each intended to increase the capabilities of the smart car. In this document, I will be focusing on requirements that pertain to a specfic part found within the scope of Project 4: distance detection. After discussing the requirements, I will also discuss the stakeholders and constraints.
### - Project 4 -
In Project 4 of the FreeNove Smart Car Project, one of the main objectives is having the car detect the distance between itself and the ball it is trying to identify. The following are functional and non-functional requirements necessary for this to occur.

### Functional Requirements
* The car should be able to find balls based on a sequence provided by the user. 
* The car should come to a stop once it has come within two feet of the ball next in sequence.
* The car should signal to the user that it has found a ball in the sequence by flashing its LED lights.

### Non-Functional Requirements
* The car should be of good size (not too small but not too large) so that it is easy to follow and easy to store.
* The car should have bright LED lights so the user can easily tell when it has accomplished a task.
*  The car should move in easy-to-follow motions, so the user can understand what it is "thinking" as it finds the balls.
  

## Stakeholders
The following are possible stakeholders for our project.

### User
1) Kids
2) Other interns working in a related field / on a related project

* The requirements of these users would likely include 1) easily being able to understand how to operate the car, 2) being entertained by the abilities of the car, and 3) having an enjoyable experience while working with the car.
  
### Producer
1) Software Development Interns

* The software development interns are the main individuals responsible for bringing this project to life.
* The software dvelopment interns would likely require the following: 1) A realistic time frame to accomplish each project within the main project, 2) Starting code that is understandable and 3) Access to resources needed to implement the features of the project.

### Acquirer
1) A company that specializes in AI-powered machines and toys
2) Colleges or Universities with AI-focused courses and labs

   * The above groups could serve as potential acquirers to our project. To ensure that our product fits their needs, these groups would most likely require the following:
     1) That our product works efficiently.
     2) That our product can easily be explained to others.
     3) That our product has a failry easy setup process.
     4) That our product has a price that is proportionate to the benefits it poses.
     
## Constraints
The following are constraints that could pose as limitations to our project.

1) Time Constraint: The small amount of time available for this project could make it difficult for all of the parts of the projects to be completed completely or atleast efficiently. This could be detrimental in making sure that all requirements,  from the users to the acquirers, are met.

2) Environmental Constraint: A large part of our project is having our smart car move around and about. If the car does not have enough space to move freely, the car will not properly accomplish its main tasks, which can result in a compromised user experience.
