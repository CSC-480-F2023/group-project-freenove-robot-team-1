# - Distance Detection -
Our FreeNove Smart Car Project includes four projects, each intended to increase the capabilities of the smart car. In this document, I will be focusing on requirements that pertain to a specific part of our project: distance detection. After discussing the requirements for this part, I will also discuss plausible stakeholders and constraints. First, let's define a persona:

## Stakeholder Persona: Artificialla Intelligenceson (Smart Car Evaluator)
Job Summary: Ms. Intelligenceson works for a prestigious company that buys freenove smart cars. This company only wants smart cars that can successfully detect balls, change their LED lights, stay within a certain boundary, and related tasks (essentially, all of the requirements outlined in our project). Her job is to evaluate smart cars when a group of people like ourselves hopes to have our smart car purchased by a big company.

#### Motivations: Ms. Intelligenceson has been hired by her company to do the following:
* Identify smart cars that meet the standards set by her company.
* Find smart car producers who are capable of producing products that maintain her company's reputation.

Make sure that evaluated smart cars:
- Have infrared sensors that operate correctly
-  Come to a complete when they contact a ball
- Change their LED lights to the same light as the ball it bumps into
- Stay within the given boundary


#### Frustrations:
Ms. Intelligenceson will report to her company if any of the cars:

* Have infrared sensors that do not operate correctly
* Do not come to a complete when they contact a ball
* Change their LED lights to a different light as the ball it bumps into
* Do not stay within the given boundary


### Distance Detection Requirements 
One of the main objectives of the FreeNove Smart Car Project is to have the car detect the distance between itself and the ball it is trying to identify. 

The following are functional and non-functional requirements necessary for this to occur.

### Functional Requirements
* The car should come to a stop once it has come within two feet of the ball next in sequence.

### Non-Functional Requirements
* The car should come to a stop within five seconds. 
  
## Stakeholders
The following are possible stakeholders for our project, separated into four groups: user, producer, acquirer, and regulator.

### User
1) Kids / Children 
2) Other interns working in a related field / on a related project

* The requirements of these users would likely include 1) easily being able to understand how to operate the car, 2) being entertained by the abilities of the car, and 3) having an enjoyable experience while working with the car.
  
### Producer
1) My group members and myself are the producers of this project.

* We are the main individuals responsible for bringing this project to life.
* In the event that we were actually assigned the task of accomplishing this project, we would likely require the following: 1) A realistic time frame to accomplish each of the smaller tasks that make up the project, 2) Starting code that is understandable and allows us to more comfortably begin coding, and 3) Access to relevant resources needed to implement the features of the project, such as workspaces, software, materials to assemble the smart car and the boundary, etc.

### Acquirer
1) A company that specializes in AI-powered machines and toys
2) Colleges or Universities with AI-focused courses and labs

   * The above groups could serve as potential acquirers of our project. To ensure that our product fits their needs, these groups would most likely require the following:
     1) That our product works efficiently.
     2) That our product can easily be explained to others.
     3) That our product has a fairly easy setup process.
     4) That our product has a price that is proportionate to the benefits it poses.

### Regulator
1) Professor Munday.
   
## Constraints
The following are constraints that could pose as limitations to our project.

1) Time Constraint: The small amount of time available for this project could make it difficult for all of the parts of the project to be completed completely or at least efficiently. This could be detrimental in making sure that all requirements,  from the users to the acquirers, are met.

2) Environmental Constraint: A large part of our project is having our smart car move around and about. If the car does not have enough space to move freely, the car will not properly accomplish its main tasks, which can result in a compromised user experience.
