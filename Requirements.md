# Project Requirements
Our FreeNove Smart Car Project includes four parts, each intended to increase the capabilities of the smart car. In this document, I will be focusing on requirements that pertain to Part 1. After discussing the requirements, I will also discuss the stakeholders and constraints.
## Part 1 
In Part 1 of the FreeNove Smart Car Project, the main objective is understanding the motion of the vehicle and its sensors by having the car traverse a track.
